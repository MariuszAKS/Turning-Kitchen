# Turning Kitchen

A game made for the [Mini Jam 189: Cooking](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-189-cooking) hosted by [ZahranW](https://zahranworrell.itch.io/)

**Theme:** Cooking

**Limitation:** Time is the enemy

**Idea:** Zombie apocalypse, you got bitten. You are a cook that ends up in the kitchen because they need the medicine that temporarily stops the infection. Finish all orders before time runs out to get it and not turn.
